# Spark in Action, 2nd edition - chapter 7

Welcome to Spark with Java, chapter 7. This chapter covers file ingestion from CSV, JSON, XML, and text.

## Lab

Each chapter has one or more labs. Labs are examples used for teaching in the book(https://www.manning.com/books/spark-in-action-second-edition?a_aid=jgp). You are encouraged to take ownership of the code and modify it, experiment with it, hence the use of the term **lab**. This chapter has only one lab.

### Lab \#200

The `ComplexCsvToDataframeApp` application does the following:

1.	It acquires a session (a `SparkSession`).
2.	It asks Spark to load (ingest) a dataset in CSV format.
3.	It demonstrates how to add input options for the underlying data source.

## Running the lab in Java

For information on running the Java lab, see chapter 1 in [Spark in Action, 2nd edition](http://jgp.net/sia).

## Running the lab using PySpark

Prerequisites:

You will need:
 * `git`.
 * Apache Spark (please refer Appendix P - "Spark in production: installation and a few tips").

1. Clone this project

    git clone https://github.com/jgperrin/net.jgp.books.spark.ch07

2. Go to the lab in the Python directory

    cd net.jgp.books.spark.ch07/src/main/python/lab200_csv_ingestion/

3. Execute the following spark-submit command to create a jar file to our this application

   ```
    spark-submit complexCsvToDataframeApp.py
   ```

## Running the lab in Scala

Prerequisites:

You will need:
 * `git`.
 * Apache Spark (please refer Appendix P - "Spark in production: installation and a few tips"). 

1. Clone this project

    git clone https://github.com/jgperrin/net.jgp.books.spark.ch07

2. cd net.jgp.books.spark.ch07

3. Package application using sbt command

   ```
     sbt clean assembly
   ```

4. Run Spark/Scala application using spark-submit command as shown below:

   ```
     spark-submit --class net.jgp.books.spark.ch07.lab200_csv_ingestion.ComplexCsvToDataframeScalaApp target/scala-2.12/SparkInAction2-Chapter07-assembly-1.0.0.jar
   ```   
   
Notes: 
 1. [Java] Due to renaming the packages to match more closely Java standards, this project is not in sync with the book's MEAP prior to v10 (published in April 2019).
 2. [Scala, Python] As of MEAP v14, we have introduced Scala and Python examples (published in October 2019).
